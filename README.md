# Detecting Floors in residential buildings

This is the code used in the paper "Detecting floors in residential buildings".
Each proposed method can be found in a seperate Jupyter-Notebook file. 
The filesize of the trained model to detect facade objects was too big, therefore it is saved in this cloud: https://cloud.scadsai.uni-leipzig.de/index.php/s/7xpk7SmgLHcMsWB. Please download it from here and place it in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebooks.
A selection of images of our dataset can be found in the folder "test-imgs". 

Please check all filepaths before running the code!
